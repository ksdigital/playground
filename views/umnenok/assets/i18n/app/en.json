She is 6 years old, at home we speak German, so she barely hears Russian words. I decided to try this game and my daughter, finally, began to put syllables into words!  Before that I tried lots of other methods but no results at all .. In general, I recommend this game ! \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFC"

Earlier learning the alphabet was a challenge, now he is genuinely interested in it and wants to play. And I'm very glad\uD83D\uDE05 I'm trying to pronounce the letters with him out loud before typing, he repeats after me. Magic phone is great, thank you! \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC"
